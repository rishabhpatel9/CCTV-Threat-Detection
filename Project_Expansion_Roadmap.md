# Project Expansion Roadmap

This document outlines the sequential phases and features required to transform this project into a production ready, local first security solution for home and office environments. These enhancements focus on streamlining the initial setup, improving detection intelligence, and providing a unified monitoring experience.

## Phase 1: Docker Image and Build Optimization

Efficient containerization is critical for both the deployment speed and the storage footprint on local edge servers.

1. [X] **Docker Ignore Pattern Implementation**
    - Initial goal - Define a strict `.dockerignore` to exclude large training datasets, git history, and local caches from the build context, ensuring a lean image.
    - Current status - Excluded all unnecessary files from the docker images.
2. [X] **Selective File Selection in Dockerfiles**
    - Initial goal - Refactor Dockerfiles to use specific `COPY` commands for only necessary source files (e.g., separating backend weights from frontend code), preventing cross service bloat.
    - Current status - Separated backend and frontend code and optimized dockerfiles.
3. [X] **External Model Weight Management**
    - Initial goal - Transition from baking weights into the image to using volume mounts or a runtime download script, decoupling large binaries from the portable code image.
    - Current status - Models have been uploaded to huggingface hub and will be auto downloaded when the api is run.
4. [ ] **Multi-Stage Build Architecture**
    - Initial goal - Implement multi-stage Docker builds to ensure that build-time dependencies are discarded in the final production runtime image.
    - Current status -

## Phase 2: Streamlined Onboarding and Installation

To achieve an "it just works" experience, the barrier to entry must be lowered. The current manual steps involve multiple dependencies and large file downloads that are prone to failure.

1. [ ] **Integrated Model Manager**
    - Initial goal - Provide a startup script that automatically checks for the existence of required weights in the `Notebooks/` directory. If missing, it should download them from a cloud source like Google Drive or Hugging Face. This eliminates the dependency on Git LFS for end users.
    - Current status -
2. [ ] **Concurrent Multi Stream Support**
    - Initial goal - Re-engineer the backend to ingest and process multiple live video feeds simultaneously. This includes managing independent per camera buffers and ensuring that the inference engine can handle concurrent requests without bottlenecking.
    - Current status -
3. [ ] **Graphic Configuration Wizard**
    - Initial goal - Replace the `.env` manual editing process with a first run configuration UI in Streamlit. This wizard should help users set their camera source, sensitivity thresholds, and notification credentials without touching code.
    - Current status -
4. [ ] **Multi Camera Discovery (ONVIF/RTSP)**
    - Initial goal - Add a utility to scan the local network for IP cameras supporting the ONVIF protocol. This allows users to import multiple camera feeds simply by clicking "Add Found Camera" rather than manually typing long RTSP URLs.
    - Current status -

## Phase 3: Core ML Intelligence and Privacy

Current models detect general threats but lack the nuance needed for a private home or office.

1. [ ] **Face Recognition (Whitelisting)**
    - Initial goal - Integrate a lightweight face recognition module (like FaceNet or dlib) to distinguish between regular residents or employees and unknown individuals. This allows the system to suppress alerts when a known family member walks through the living room, significantly reducing alert fatigue.
    - Current status -
2. [ ] **Privacy Zones and Exclusion Masking**
    - Initial goal - Implement a UI feature that allows users to "paint" or draw polygons over the camera feed. Areas like a busy sidewalk or an oscillating fan should be masked out to prevent them from triggering false anomaly detections.
    - Current status -
3. [ ] **Object Tracking and Temporal Persistence**
    - Initial goal - Currently, the system analyzes frames in relative isolation. Integrating a tracker like BoT-SORT will allow the system to count how long a person has been in a specific area. This enables features like loitering detection (alert if someone stands near the door for more than 5 minutes).
    - Current status -
4. [ ] **Geofencing and Virtual Tripwires**
    - Initial goal - Allow users to define virtual lines across a doorway or driveway. Instead of alerting on any movement, the system only triggers if an object crosses the line in a specific direction (such as someone entering the house).
    - Current status -

## Phase 4: Unified Management and Event History

The current interface is built for real time demos. A security system needs historical context.

1. [ ] **Unified NVR Dashboard**
    - Initial goal - Create a centralized dashboard that supports a grid view (2x2 or 3x3) of multiple camera streams. The interface should allow clicking on a specific stream to maximize it and view live metrics.
    - Current status -
2. [ ] **Local Event Database (SQLite/DuckDB)**
    - Initial goal - Log every detection event into a local database. Each entry should include a timestamp, threat category, confidence score, and a reference to the saved snapshot image or 5 second video clip.
    - Current status -
3. [ ] **Event Timeline and Search**
    - Initial goal - Provide a searchable history page with filters for time, camera ID, and threat level. Users should be able to quickly find all violence alerts from a specific camera without scrolling through raw logs.
    - Current status -
4. [ ] **Circular Clip Storage**
    - Initial goal - Manage local storage by implementing a cleanup policy. For example, keep high confidence threat clips for 30 days and safe clips for only 24 hours, automatically deleting the oldest data when the disk reaches 90 percent capacity.
    - Current status -

## Phase 5: Notifications and Connectivity

Security is only useful if the user can be notified immediately when away from the console.

1. [ ] **Universal Push Notifications**
    - Initial goal - Integrate support for free, open source notification services like Ntfy or Gotify, in addition to Firebase Cloud Messaging. This allows users to receive instant mobile alerts with preview images without a paid SMS subscription.
    - Current status -
2. [ ] **Mobile Web Application (PWA)**
    - Initial goal - Optimize the Streamlit frontend for mobile browsers or convert it into a Progressive Web App (PWA). This ensures the dashboard is easily accessible on a smartphone with a native app feel.
    - Current status -
3. [ ] **Discord and Telegram Integration**
    - Initial goal - Add bots that can post snapshots directly into a private Discord or Telegram channel. This is often the preferred way for families or small teams to coordinate security responses.
    - Current status -
4. [ ] **Home Automation Hooks (MQTT/Webhooks)**
    - Initial goal - Expose an MQTT broker interface or outbound webhooks. This allows the system to trigger external actions, such as turning on the porch lights if a weapon is detected or locking smart doors if a significant anomaly is flagged.
    - Current status -

## Phase 6: Hardware Acceleration and Portability

To run continuously, the system must be efficient and portable.

1. [ ] **Edge Device Support (TPU/NPU)**
    - Initial goal - Optimize models for specialized hardware like the Coral Edge TPU (using TensorFlow Lite) or Intel Myriad X (using OpenVINO). This allows the system to run on a Raspberry Pi at high frame rates while consuming very little power.
    - Current status -
2. [ ] **Sliding Window Inference for Long Videos**
    - Initial goal - The current API takes 16 frames and returns one score. For long running camera streams, implement a rolling buffer that performs inference every few seconds, ensuring that a quick 1 second threat (like drawing a weapon) isn't missed because it happened between sample windows.
    - Current status -
3. [ ] **Audio Anomaly Detection**
    - Initial goal - Use the microphone feed (if available) to detect specialized sounds like glass breaking, shouting, or gunshots. Combining audio with visual data provides a much more robust fusion layer for high stakes security.
    - Current status -

## Phase 7: Specialized Safety Features

Beyond crime detection, the system can provide value for safety and wellness.

1. [ ] **Fall and Inactivity Detection**
    - Initial goal - Implement human pose estimation with a specific focus on falls or long periods of inactivity. This is a high value feature for elderly care in home environments or for monitoring lone workers in office warehouses.
    - Current status -
2. [ ] **Smoke and Fire Detection**
    - Initial goal - Train or integrate a dedicated model to identify early signs of smoke or flames. This provides an additional layer of safety that traditional smoke detectors might miss if they are not in the direct vicinity of the fire.
    - Current status -
3. [ ] **Package and Delivery Detection**
    - Initial goal - Add a specific classification head to YOLO for identifying boxes and mail. The system can send a package delivered notification and continue to monitor the package until a known family member retrieves it.
    - Current status -
